# Drowsiness-Detector
This repo is useful to determine how long a given person’s eyes have been closed for and also for the yawn detection. If there eyes have been closed for a certain amount of time, we’ll assume that they are starting to doze off and play an alarm to wake them up and grab their attention right through the siren sound.
Drivers must keep a close eye on the road, so they can react to sudden events immediately. Driver fatigue often becomes a direct cause of many accidents. Therefore, there is a need to develop the systems that will detect and notify a driver of her/him bad psychophysical condition, which could significantly reduce the number of fatigue-related car accidents. However, the development of such systems encounters many difficulties related to fast and proper recognition of a driver’s fatigue symptoms. 
One of the technical possibilities to implement driver drowsiness detection systems is to use the vision-based approach.

This drowsiness detector hinged on two important computer vision techniques:

(1) Facial landmark detection
(2) Eye aspect ratio
(3) Mouth aspect ratio
